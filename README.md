# Problem statement

### **AS A** commuter in the Netherlands,
### **I WANT** to see nearby trains, their arrival times, and the train features.
### -------------------------------------------

### **GIVEN** a moblile-friendly application,
### **WHEN** I click on a station on a map,
### **THEN** I get a list of trains arriving.  
### **WHEN** I choose a train,
### **THEN** I get a picture of the train, the train's arrival time, and the train car features. 
### **WHEN** I frequently select a specific station,
### **THEN** it will be saved to my favorites list.
### -------------------------------------------
## The application uses the Dutch national rail company (NS rail) API to find trains and Google maps API or TomTom API for location and routing.
