# Problem statement

### **AS A** commuter in the Netherlands,
### **I WANT** to see nearby trains, their arrival times, and the train features.
### -------------------------------------------

### **GIVEN** A moblile-friendly application,
### **WHEN** I identify my location (in the Netherlands) on a map,
### **THEN** I get a list of trains nearby.  
### **WHEN** I choose a train,
### **THEN** I get a picture of the train, the train's arrival time, and the train car features. 
### -------------------------------------------
## The application uses the Dutch national rail company (NS rail) API to find trains and Google maps API or TomTom API for location and routing.
