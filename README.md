# Problem statement

### **AS A** Dutch trainspotter
### **I WANT** To see trains near-by and how to get to them
### -------------------------------------------

### **GIVEN** A moblile -friendly app
### **WEHEN** I enter my location (in the Netherlands) as a position on a map
### **THEN** I get a list of trains nearby  
### **WHEN** I choose a train
### **THEN** I get a picture of the train (optional)
### **WHEN** I choose a mode of transportation (i'm guessing google has that in their API) 
### **THEN** I will know how long time it will take to get to there  
### -------------------------------------------
## The App uses the Dutch national rail company (NS rail) API to find trains and Google maps API or TomTom API for location and routing
